# Getting-Started-With-Computer-Vision
Convolutional Neural Network trained for binary classification.

I used a good Dogs & Cats images dataset found on Kaggle you can find it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images">here</a>.

I created this convloutional network using keras library to build and train the model and OpenCV to process the images. <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> is a powerful and easy to use for building neural network, so it's your best option when you're starting to learn how to build neural network.
